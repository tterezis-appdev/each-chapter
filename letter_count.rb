# Write a program that:
# 
# Asks the user to enter a word. The program should 
# print each letter in the word the number of times 
# it appears in the word.
#
# Example (`loop` is the input):
# 
#   "Enter a word"
#   loop
#   l appears 1 times
#   o appears 2 times
#   o appears 2 times
#   p appears 1 times

p "Enter a word:"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# letter_count.rb prints the letters and number of times the letters appear for the word 'levee' 
#
# letter_count.rb prints the letters and number of times the letters appear for the word 'loop'
